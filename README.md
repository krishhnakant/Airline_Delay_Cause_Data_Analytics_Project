# Airline_Delay_Cause_Data_Analytics_Project
This project creates a way for the future AI models for Data Science operations for the accurate predictions for the future occurences through data driven decisions.

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airline arrival delays using real-world operational data.
The goal is to identify delay trends, root causes, airline performance issues, and operational risks through Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and interactive Power BI dashboards.

The project follows industry-standard analytics workflows, making it suitable for:

Business Intelligence roles

Data Analyst / Operations Analyst roles

Airline / Logistics / Transportation analytics use cases

🎯 Business Objectives

Understand overall airline delay patterns

Identify major contributors to arrival delays

Analyze seasonality and trends over time

Compare airline performance

Provide manager-ready KPIs and insights for decision-making

📂 Dataset Information

Dataset Name: Airline Delay Cause Data

Granularity: Airline, Airport, Month, Year

Key Metrics:

Number of flights

Arrival delays

Cancellations & diversions

Delay causes (Carrier, Weather, NAS, Security, Late Aircraft)

🔄 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading

Imported raw CSV data into Python

Verified schema, column names, and data types

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Python

Performed comprehensive EDA including:

✔ Data Cleaning

Handled missing values using inplace=True

Removed duplicates

Corrected data types

Treated outliers where required

✔ Statistical Analysis

Summary statistics

Distribution analysis

Correlation analysis

✔ Visual Analysis

Box plots (Outlier Analysis)

Histograms & Histplots with KDE

Line plots (Trend Analysis)

Heatmaps (Correlation Analysis)

📌 Outcome:
A clean, analysis-ready dataset exported for Power BI.

3️⃣ Data Modeling – Power BI

Loaded cleaned dataset into Power BI Desktop

Verified relationships & data types

Optimized model for performance

4️⃣ DAX Measures Created

Key industry-standard KPIs:

Total Flights
